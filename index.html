        <h2 class="about-me">About Me</h2>
        <p>I am Hunter Wilson and I am currently a student at Georgia Tech Coding
          Bootcamp. I have always had a passion for technology and problem-solving, and decided to pursue a career in web development. Through the bootcamp, I have gained a strong foundation in modern technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
          
          Aside from my technical skills, I am a strong team player and have excellent communication and time management skills. I am constantly looking for ways to improve and expand my knowledge, and am excited to start my career in the tech industry.</p>
          
          In my free time, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest trends in technology and participating in online coding challenges. I am also an avid reader and enjoy spending time outdoors.
          Thank you for taking the time to read about me. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute my skills and learn from others in a professional setting.
